This is a plugin for the Cytoscape application. As of now, the plugin 
can calculate the degree, adjacency, and laplcian matrices from a given 
network. Additionally, it can create a new network. Features that needed to be
added are finding connected components and creating a new network with a given
table ( internal representation of the graph ). The Colt library is used
for Matrix handling and operations.
